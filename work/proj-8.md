title: "Stripes & Co"

Code Course is a youtube channel that teaches code. They were formally known as pHp academy and are in the process of rebranding. The goal was to design an identity that was sleek and modern. An identity that would speak to his current subscribers: tech, engineers, designers. 

The first logo you see here is the one that was selected as the direction for the brand identity. However, it is necessary to showcase a snapshot of the different directions this project could have gone. Enjoy!
