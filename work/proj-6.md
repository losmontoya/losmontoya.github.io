Makers is a self-initiated project. I wanted to create a Vine in which I would leave inspirational design tips. The purpose of this face was to start branding the Vine. In the clips he would show up at the end of the videos and act as a transition between the looping video clip. In doing this, each video would re-enforce the Makers brand.
