Ship.io offers a product that helps app developer ship apps faster by creating a simple and powerful CI.  Part of my work for them was to put together some marketing material to advertise on Twitter and Facebook. As an early stage startup they did not have the time to hold my hand through the brainstorming process. The direction was straight-forward. We want to communicate that Ship.io works with thirds party apps, git repo's, and for the iOS and Android platforms. My job was to take that and create something compelling and exciting. This is that creation.
