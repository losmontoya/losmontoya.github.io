<p>Logo Concepts: We launched POP Messenger to the iOS, Android, and Windows app stores Summer of 2014. However, before launching with the name and logo that we now have we went through a branding and naming process. We established 4 core names we could go with. The challenge was on getting stakeholders to agree on a name. Part of the challenge was that it is hard to pick a direction when just looking at names on a slide deck, thus I created logoâ€™s for each direction so that they all had a competing chance. The winner was POP.</p>
